# Decentralized ETF Arbitrage Network

Author: Samson Boicu

### Overview

This repository demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a “Decentralized ETF Arbitrage Network.” The system aims to exploit ETF NAV discrepancies via blockchain-settled P2P trading, bridging on-chain execution to Interactive Brokers (IBKR), and leveraging advanced analytics (PCA) for basket component weighting.

### Features

1. **Arbitrage Engine (Solidity)**
   - Flash Loan integration (Aave/Compound stubs)
   - Real-time AP flow triggers
   - On-chain transaction settlement

2. **zk-SNARKs Stub (Solidity)**
   - Illustrates how to incorporate zero-knowledge proof verification on-chain

3. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - FINRA Rule 5320 checks
   - Placeholder for ERC-20 audit logs
   - Potential circuit breaker oracles for SEC Regulation SHO

4. **IBKR Bridge (Go)**
   - Chainlink Oracle stub to fetch off-chain data and place equity orders
   - On-chain verification of execution proof (planned with ZK-SNARKs or MPC for signal hiding)

5. **Basket Analysis (Python)**
   - PCA-based decomposition of basket securities
   - Example input CSV for sample ETF baskets
   - Generates recommended weighting schema

### Tech Stack

- **Solidity** for smart contracts
- **Hardhat** for contract compilation, deployment, and testing
- **Go** for IBKR bridging
- **Python** for PCA basket analysis
- **The Graph Protocol (Conceptual)** for indexing on-chain/off-chain data
- **AWS Local Zones (Conceptual)** for edge computing in APAC/EMEA

### Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Solidity contracts for arbitrage logic, ZK verification, and compliance
- `bridge/`: Go-based IBKR Bridge with Chainlink Oracle stub
- `analysis/`: PCA analysis Python script
- `scripts/`: Hardhat deployment scripts
- `hardhat.config.js`: Hardhat configuration

### Installation
